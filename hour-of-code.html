                    <h2>What's Hour Of Code?</h2>
                    <p>The Hour of Code is a free introduction to computer science through fun activities and videos for learners of all skill levels.
                        This year's celebration of both coding and AI is supported by over 400 partners, 20,000 educators, and 58,000 volunteers.

                    <h2>Our Team's Hour Of Code</h2>
                    <p>
                        We organized our Hour of Code in Turkiye Diyanet Foundation Baku Turkish Lyceum.
                        Our main goal was to teach students how to build certain blocks to complete tasks
                        and also how to use these blocks in the most efficient and simple way.
                    </p>

            <div>
                <h2></h2>
            </div>
            <div class="line" id="line-3">
                <div class="line-text">
                    <h2>Results</h2>
                    <p>
                        Even though not all kids could solve the given task at first,
                        but with our help after a few mistakes, they all were understanding
                        the way they should approach the task and how to minimalize their code.
                        By the end of the lesson most of students had completed all tasks 
                        and recieved their certificates.
