                We have built this website, so you can learn about us and what we are doing.
                We have taught Hour Of Code in Turkiye Diyanet Foundation Baku Turkish Lyceum.
                It was a great event, where we taught children basic principles of programming,
                like loops, and conditional statements and how to use them to achieve the desirable goal
